# Neurowell - AI-Powered Mental Wellness Platform

## Project Overview
Neurowell is an AI-driven mental wellness platform designed to analyze stress levels using **Deep Learning (ANN)**. The system provides real-time mental health insights based on user inputs and physiological data, helping individuals track and improve their well-being.

---

## Features
- **AI-Based Stress Prediction**: Uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict stress levels.
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Leverages **Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow** for data preprocessing and model training.
- **Web-Based Platform**: Built with **React.js (Frontend) and Flask (Backend)**.
- **REST API Integration**: Flask API connects the ML model to the frontend for real-time stress analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays stress patterns and historical trends using interactive graphs.

## Tech Stack
### **Frontend**
- React.js
- CSS (Tailwind CSS)

### **Backend**
- Flask (Python-based REST API)
  
### **Machine Learning & AI**
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy , Sklearn
- ANN (Artificial Neural Network)

## Installation 

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tyagi0320/NeuroWell.git
cd NeuroWell
```
### 2. Set Up Backend (Server)
  
- Navigate to the frontend directory:

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  ```
- Refer Runbackend.txt

### 3. Set Up Frontend (React)

- Navigate to the frontend directory:

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  ```

- Install required dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Start the React development server:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

The React app will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🔬 Model Training & Evaluation
- The **Kaggle dataset** was used for training the ANN model.
- Preprocessing steps included **feature selection, normalization, and data augmentation**.
- Achieved **85% accuracy** in stress level classification.
- Model is optimized with **early stopping and dropout techniques** to prevent overfitting.
