# Neurowell - AI-Powered Mental Wellness Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
Neurowell is an AI-driven mental wellness platform designed to analyze stress levels using **Deep Learning (ANN)**. The system provides real-time mental health insights based on user inputs and physiological data, helping individuals track and improve their well-being.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧠 **AI-Based Stress Prediction**: Uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict stress levels.
- 🔬 **Advanced Data Processing**: Leverages **Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow** for data preprocessing and model training.
- 🌐 **Web-Based Platform**: Built with **React.js (Frontend) and Flask (Backend)**.
- 🔗 **REST API Integration**: Flask API connects the ML model to the frontend for real-time stress analysis.
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Displays stress patterns and historical trends using interactive graphs.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
### **Frontend**
- React.js
- CSS (Tailwind CSS, if applicable)

### **Backend**
- Flask (Python-based REST API)
- MongoDB (if used for storing user data)

### **Machine Learning & AI**
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- ANN (Artificial Neural Network) for stress level prediction

## 🔬 Model Training & Evaluation
- The **Kaggle dataset** was used for training the ANN model.
- Preprocessing steps included **feature selection, normalization, and data augmentation**.
- Achieved **85% accuracy** in stress level classification.
- Model is optimized with **early stopping and dropout techniques** to prevent overfitting.
